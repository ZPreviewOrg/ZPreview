# 🔄 GitHub-based Grant Management System Workflow

An automated workflow system for managing different types of grant applications and payments through GitHub, utilizing, issues, status, labels, and assignments. The system automatically responds to different combinations of an issue's current status and labels to maintain the grant lifecycle.

When a change occurs on a grant application issue, the workflow system:

1. Checks the Current Status of the grant
2. Checks the Current Labels on the issue
3. Performs automated actions:
   - Updates Labels (adding/removing as needed)
   - Changes Assignments of the issue to relevant teams/individuals
   - Posts standardized comment templates
   - Updates the overall grant Status

Unless otherwise specific any changes made create a PR which created and merged to the corresponding grants file within the GitHub repository.
